# Pocket Projects
This is a repository containing my aggregated scripts which according to me are not big enough to have their own repositories. 

# Projects

## [findLinks](findLinks)
Used to find links with different extensions on a webpage and print them. Useful for searching for images/videos on a page so that they can be later downloaded.

## [image2ascii](image2ascii)
A very simple image to ascii converter which converts an image to an ascii art representation of the image.

## [jumpingWindows](jumpingWindows)
A Windows only program that is my take on playing around with winapi, particularly regarding window objects. Makes windows of specified names bounce around the screen. Just for fun.

## [shiftSrt](shiftSrt)
A simple regex-based program that shifts the subtitles written in SRT format. Supports both constant offset and linear transformation of the sub times.
